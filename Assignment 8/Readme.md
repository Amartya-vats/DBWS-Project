Assignment 8:
    We were suppose to create users with different premissions to our database.
    This was acheived by using configs for each type to user. However we did face
    problems as clamv did not allow us to create users on the database. We are also
    using the "test" database on clamv as our database as we were facing issues 
    which we had discussed.

    We have now created an new table admin_user. For using admin permission :

    Username : admin
    Password : admin1234
